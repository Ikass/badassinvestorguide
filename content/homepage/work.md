I believe that Personal Finance and Investing does not have to be boring, complicated or time-consuming. Even if you are not a numbers person, are extremely busy professional, or sleep-deprived parent, or just have better things to do than budget your expenses and research stocks - knowing and applying simple and sound principles will help you to reach your financial goals and feel financially secure. You will enjoy a sense of freedom and choices that (only) comes from being financially secure and independent.
