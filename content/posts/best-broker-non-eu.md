You’ve saved some money and would like to begin investing, preferably into index fund ETFs with low expense ratios. You plan to follow a buy and hold, long-term investment strategy. You need a good online broker with low fees, that is available in your country.

> I don’t even know where to start. This is something that has kept me up at night!

The problem is, your local bank charges outrageous fees, and to be frank, you don’t really trust them. During your research you found popular European discount broker Degiro with zero fees. You were ready to transfer your savings, only to find out they do not serve customers from your country, and have no plans to further expand into Europe. 

You *could* open an account in one of the supported countries, if you could get a bank account in EU, but is it worth risking them terminating your account if they find out?

The other most recommended online broker is Interactive Brokers. A well established brokerage that provides access to most exchanges and financial instruments. With a somewhat clunky user interface that takes some getting used to, especially for beginners. And then there is the monthly minimum fee amount of 10 dollars.

Paying 10 dollars per month just to have a broker account (120 dollars per year!) is a big deal, if you plan to invest 100 euros per month - that’s about 10% loss right off the bat! It will seriously slow down your wealth accumulation.

> Am I doing something wrong or is this really how much you pay in fees for your brokerage account?

## What are your options?

There are many online brokers that offer their services in non-EU countries. Some are zero-fee brokers, making you question their business model and viability for long-term investments. Others are more focused on forex or day traders, not long-term buy and hold investors. Not optimal choices.

Thankfully, there are a handful brokers that offer the best of both worlds - a well established and safe platform, with one of the widest selection of financial instruments - stocks, bonds, ETFs, options etc. - from most stock exchanges of the world, combined with low fees and commissions. They are Interactive Brokers resellers. Meaning, they offer you access to the IB platform, for slightly higher fees, but charge no monthly fees. If you plan to invest smaller amounts once a month - for example, buying shares of a single fund in any given month - then these are your best choices.

After doing extensive research and opening accounts with several online brokers, I have to conclude that the best online broker for residents of non-EU countries that want to invest small(er) sums monthly into ETFs with a buy & hold long-term strategy is TradeStation Global.

TradeStation Global is a UK based subsidiary of TradeStation International, as US-based company, that provides access to the Interactive Brokers platform (a reseller). In short, they provide a well-priced access to the IB platform in most countries.

## Commissions & Fees

Let's compare the Commissions and Fees structure of Interactive Brokers and their European reseller TradeStation Global. We'll look at buying euro denominated ETFs at Frankfurt stock exchange [Xetra](https://www.xetra.com/xetra-en/) and British pound denonimated ETFs at the [London Stock Exchange](https://www.londonstockexchange.com/home/homepage.htm).

| Commissions & Fees | IB (Tiered Pricing)                                        | IB (Fixed Pricing)                                     | TradeStation Global                        |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Xetra, ETFs in EUR | 0.05% fee par trade value, 1.25-29 EUR per order (min-max) | 0.1% fee par trade value, 4-29 EUR per order (min-max) | 0.12% fee par trade value, 1.8 EUR minimum |
| LSE, ETFs in GBP   | 0.05%, 1 GBP per order                                     | 6 GBP per order                                        | 0.12% fee par trade value, 1.5 GBP minimum |
| Monthly Fee        | 10 USD, minus generated commissions                        | 10 USD, minus generated commissions                    | 0                                          |

- [TradeStation Global pricing structure](https://www.tradestation-international.com/global/stock-trading-commissions/#1489138650610-6ebf4fb9-d1f9)


Now, let’s apply that to your situation and do some math. We’ll assume you are starting small and invest only 100 euros per month, buying shares of one ETF in the German Frankfurt Xetra stock exchange.

- 100 euros by 0.05% = 0.05 euros, so we will pay the 1.25 euros minimum fee for the **IB tiered pricing structure**. Since our commissions did not reach the 10 USD minimum, we will pay the 10 USD minus the 1.25 EUR commission. To sum it up, our single trade of 100 euros costs us 10 USD.

- For the **IB fixed pricing tier**, the commission per trade is 0.1% x 100 euros = 0.1 euro, but the minimum is 4 euros. Since we did not reach the monthly minimum, we pay 10 USD. Ouch.

- For **TradeStation Global** the commission is 0.12% x 100 euros = 0.12 euros, but the minimum is 1.8 euros. Since they do not charge monthly fee, then the trade costs us 1.8 euros. It is still 1.8% of the trade, but much better than paying 10 USD.

Now, if we were to invest 500 euros per month, the math would be different:

- IB tiered: 500 x 0.05% = 0.25 euros, the minimum is 1.25 euros, but we still pay 10 USD total.

- IB fixed: 500 x 0.1% = 0.5 euros, the minimum is 4 euros, but we still pay 10 USD total.

- TSG: 500 x 0.12% = 0.6 euros, so we pay the minimum of 1.8 euros. That’s 0.36% of the trade value.

To put it in perspective, you would have to trade about 10 000 euros worth of ETFs per month to generate in commissions the minimum monthly fee of 10 euros on the IB fixed pricing tier commission of 0.1% per trade.

Or have 100 000 USD in the trading account to waive the monthly fee.

## Summary

So there you have it - if you are country limited in terms of availability of good online brokers, you don’t need to settle with questionable forex brokers for your long-term investments, you will be much better off by choosing a good, well-established online broker that provides access to the vast majority of stock exchanges and is available in nearly every country.
