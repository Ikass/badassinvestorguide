Why another personal finance and investing website? What’s in it for you? And who am I?

All good questions.

## Let’s start with *you* - who are you?

You’ve saved up some money and would like to start investing. You know you should be investing for the long-term, everyone is touting the virtue of passive index funds. Still others are convinced Dividend Growth Investing is the way. And then there is the <abbr title="Financial Independence Retire Early">FIRE</abbr> movement.

Whom to trust? How can you make informed decisions about your money and investments, that you know are in your best interests, aligned with your goals and values?

Perhaps you have done your research, are reasonably sure about the available options for your situation, but some details still puzzle you and you need some help in making the final decision regarding your money, investments, choosing a broker or asset allocation.

And then there is the strong and real allure of the quick win in the stock market. After all, you are smart, you should be able to figure that stuff out? Why not you, right?

Either way, you know you still have a lot to learn and keep up with. Stocks, bonds, ETFs, now there’s P2P. What is best for you? What about asset allocation and risk?

The problem is - you don’t really want to spend so much time following the stock market and economy news, researching stocks or funds, rebalancing your portfolio each quarter and so on. You’ve got better things to do - your job or business to run, hobbies to pursue, family and kids to spend time with, the world to save, and then there is that unfinished manuscript of your novel.

Do you really have to sacrifice what you value most just to manage your money and investments, in order to secure your financial future?

## Badass

Badass = being really good at something. Managing and investing money. Who has the knowledge and skills, is able and willing to make decisions, feels safe and confident in one’s choices, takes action and follows through, in it for the long haul, takes time to educate oneself.

> “Being really f’n good at something is really f’n good.”
> — <cite>Kathy Sierra</cite>

After all, you and only you care the most about your money situation and have the most to gain, or lose.
It takes a certain degree of badassery to accept responsibility for own decisions and actions, being independent in thoughts and opinions. Being self-directed and self-reliant.

## Investor

Somebody who invests their time, energy and money wisely, letting it compound and grow over time, making smart money decisions. But also somebody who understands the value of investing in oneself - informing and educating oneself, gaining new skills, changing mindset. Constantly learning and growing.

Being smart about how one spends their time, money and effort. Following the 80/20 principle - getting 80% of the results, with only 20% of the efforts (trying to pick individual stocks vs investing in passive index funds comes to mind). 

Ask yourself - in your current situation, which activity would bring you better financial results in the long-term - spending an hour a day researching stock market and trying to pick individual stocks, or investing in your skills to secure a promotion (and a raise), or starting a side-business that could eventually replace your day job?

## Guide

The plan is to create in-depth guides to help you go from a beginner to a badass with managing and investing money.

You have saved up some money, got a bonus at work, your emergency fund is ready and you want to begin investing your money. Where do you even start? Do you need to open a new bank account? Which bank, in which country? Which is the best online broker for your situation? How can you pick stocks or index fund ETFs? And what is the difference between and index fund, a mutual fund and ETFs? How should you split your investment or allocate your assets?

I’ll cover the basics of personal finance and investing - how to budget and save money, how much should you save, how to begin investing in the stock market, passive investing strategies, choosing index funds, finding the best online broker - as well as more advanced topics like asset allocation, economic cycles, money and inflation. The guides will be specifically tailored to European audience, but the basic principles apply to everyone.

My hope is to share what I have and still am learning, so that others can avoid mistakes I’ve made and achieve their financial goals easier and faster. Including my children.

## Briefly About Me

I’m a guy in my late 30s from Northern Europe, Latvia, to be precise. Which puts me in a somewhat unique position. 

Firstly, most of the available personal finance and investing information and advice on the internet is geared towards US audience, and is not necessarily directly applicable to somebody living in the EU. 

Secondly, the Baltic States and other post-Soviet countries are still ‘second grade’ EU countries, meaning, not all services available in the western countries are available (brokers, banks etc). 

Thirdly, the average income levels are much lower, but so are living costs (to a lesser degree), meaning that I need to achieve a lower net worth to achieve Financial Independence that somebody who is living, say, in Belgium or Germany.

I’ve made my share of costly mistakes with my money (don’t put your money in ‘investment’ you don’t understand, to name just one), didn’t save during my 20’s, lost money on stock options and penny stocks, wasted money on expensive toys (the Alfa Romeo was nice, though). All because I didn’t understand how the economy and money works, how to plan and take care of my finances, how to become financially independent and maybe even retire early and wealthy.

### Disclaimer:

I’m writing under a pen name - *Ray* - as my real name tends to be hard to pronounce for foreigners, but more importantly, to keep my privacy. Since one always, always has to do own due diligence and understand what they are doing with their money, then I don’t see how me writing anonymously should matter.

Secondly, I’m not a professional financial planner, investment or tax advisor or anything related, so none of what I write about should be construed as financial or investment advice, it is merely my opinion.

In short, my goal is to clarify and outline the key concepts of personal finance and investing to help you make informed decisions and to feel confident in your ability to manage your own money and investments, feel financially secure, knowing that you are on the right path for you.

***

I believe that Personal Finance and Investing does not have to be boring, complicated or time-consuming. Even if you are not a numbers person, are extremely busy professional, or sleep-deprived parent, or just have better things to do than budget your expenses and research stocks - knowing and applying simple and sound principles will help you to reach your financial goals and feel financially secure. You will enjoy a sense of freedom and choices that (only) comes from being financially secure and independent.
