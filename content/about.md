I’m a guy in my late 30s from Northern Europe, Latvia, to be precise. 

Which puts me in a somewhat unique position.

Firstly, most of the available personal finance and investing information and advice on the internet is geared towards US audience, and is not necessarily directly applicable to somebody living in the EU. 

Secondly, the Baltic States and other post-Soviet countries are still ‘second grade’ EU countries, meaning, not all services available in the western countries are available (brokers, banks etc). 

Thirdly, the average income levels are much lower, but so are living costs (to a lesser degree), meaning that I need to achieve a lower net worth to achieve Financial Independence that somebody who is living, say, in Belgium or Germany.

I’ve made my share of costly mistakes with my money (don’t put your money in ‘investment’ you don’t understand, to name just one), didn’t save during my 20’s, lost money on stock options and penny stocks, wasted money on expensive toys (the Alfa Romeo was nice, though). All because I didn’t understand how the economy and money works, how to plan and take care of my finances, how to become financially independent and maybe even retire early and wealthy.

### Disclaimer:

I’m writing under a pen name - *Ray* - as my real name tends to be hard to pronounce for foreigners, but more importantly, to keep my privacy. Since one always, always has to do own due diligence and understand what they are doing with their money, then I don’t see how me writing anonymously should matter.

Secondly, I’m not a professional financial planner, investment or tax advisor or anything related, so none of what I write about should be construed as financial or investment advice, it is merely my opinion.

In short, my goal is to clarify and outline the key concepts of personal finance and investing to help you make informed decisions and to feel confident in your ability to manage your own money and investments, feel financially secure, knowing that you are on the right path for you.

***

I believe that Personal Finance and Investing does not have to be boring, complicated or time-consuming. Even if you are not a numbers person, are extremely busy professional, or sleep-deprived parent, or just have better things to do than budget your expenses and research stocks - knowing and applying simple and sound principles will help you to reach your financial goals and feel financially secure. You will enjoy a sense of freedom and choices that (only) comes from being financially secure and independent.
